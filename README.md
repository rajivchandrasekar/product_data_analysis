**Now , REC corp needs you to solve the following questions : **
1) Is there any trend in the sales of all four products during certain months?
2) Out of all four products , which product has seen the highest sales in all the given years?
3) The company has all it's retail centers closed on the 31st of December every year. Mr: Hariharan , the CEO , would love to get an estimate on no: of units of each product that could be sold on 31st of Dec , every year , if all their retail centers were kept open.
